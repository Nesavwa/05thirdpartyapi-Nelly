Homework5nelly - ThirdpartyAPIs

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Here i have used the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.

Below are some of the screen shots of my work
